Project repo for CSCD 350

Description: This project is an application software that serves the function of a virtual closet, tentatively named ‘Wardrobe Wizard’. It will be able 
to store a list of whatever articles of clothing a user owns, and once the user uploads images of their clothing the images and descriptions of their 
clothing will be stored in their personal virtual closet. The app will then allow you to enter information about your clothes such as brand, price, size, 
and color. In addition, we will be able to sort clothing based on these attributes. ‘Wardrobe Wizard’ will support two major features: an outfit system 
and a laundry basket system. The outfit system will allow users to make sets of clothing that they frequently wear together, and store these sets to their 
profile. The laundry basket system will allow users to mark clothing as previously worn so they remember not to wear it again, and provide statistics of 
how often they wear a piece of clothing.
